However, there are significant gaps in crucial areas such as R, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Generative AI frameworks (GPT, BERT, DALL-E), NLP, computer vision, Spark, and several data visualization tools.  The projects demonstrate some engagement with KPI/KRA related to model development and deployment, but many key responsibilities and performance indicators are not explicitly addressed through project descriptions.  Specifically, developing generative AI models for text/image synthesis, data preprocessing, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and ensuring model accuracy/performance are not clearly evidenced.  A technical interview should probe deeper into the candidate's understanding and practical application of these missing mandatory skills and KPI/KRA, especially concerning generative AI and production-level model deployment.", "status": "Rejected", "projects": [{"name": "Data Science and AI Intern, Bigtapp Analytics, Remote-Hyderabad | May 2025\u2013Present", "description": "Developed a scalable RAG pipeline processing ~10 documents with 95%+ retrieval accuracy, designed for 1,000+ documents.\nBuilt a low-latency query interface handling ~50-100 queries/day, improving data access efficiency by 40%.\nCloud Intern, Encryptix, Online | Jun 2024\u2013Jul 2024\nDeveloped AWS-based web apps serving ~100 users, reducing load time by ~20% via optimized EC2 configurations.\nEnhanced UI responsiveness, increasing user engagement by 15%.\nSoftware Engineering Job Simulation, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Forage | Aug 2024\nAnalyzed ~100 stock price trends using Python, developing high-accuracy trading strategies.\nCreated visualizations with Perspective, improving strategy accuracy by 10%.\nProjects and Certifications\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline | Python, Google Gemini, Pinecone\nProcessed ~10 documents with 95%+ retrieval accuracy for document Q&A, scalable to larger datasets.\nEnabled real-time semantic search with low-latency responses (<1s).\nNatural Language Query Pipeline | Python, Streamlit, MongoDB, Redis\nSupported ~50-100 daily queries across SQL/NoSQL databases, reducing latency by ~30%.\nEnhanced multi-database query accessibility by 40% with LLM-driven interface.\nLSTM-Based Predictor | TensorFlow, Django, AWS EC2\nDeployed LSTM model with ~85% prediction accuracy, handling ~100 concurrent users.\nEnsured scalable inference with <2s response time via optimized AWS EC2.\nGraph Algorithm CLI | Python\nDeveloped a Python-based Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm CLI, optimizing shortest path computation for graphs.\nAchieved O(E + V log V) runtime using efficient heap-based data structures.\nCertifications\nAWS Cloud Practitioner | Udemy\nAWS Cloud Quest Badge | AWS\nThe Basics of Google Cloud Compute | Google Cloud\nIntroduction to Generative AI | Coursera\nIntroduction to TensorFlow for AI, ML, and Deep Learning | Coursera\nSoftware Testing | NPTEL", "skills": ["<mark>Python</mark>", "Google Gemini", "Pinecone", "<mark>Streamlit</mark>", "MongoDB", "Redis", "SQL", "<mark>TensorFlow</mark>", "Django", "<mark>AWS EC2</mark>", "<mark>Python</mark>"], "relevance": "Matches Python, TensorFlow, AWS (EC2).
