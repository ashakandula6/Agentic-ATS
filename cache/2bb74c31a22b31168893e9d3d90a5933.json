However, there are significant gaps in alignment with the mandatory technical skills, particularly concerning Generative AI frameworks (GPT, BERT, DALL-E), R programming, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and computer vision. The projects also show limited direct evidence of key responsibilities and KPIs such as designing AI models for text generation or image synthesis, data preprocessing, model deployment, and ensuring model scalability. To strengthen this profile, the candidate should highlight any experience related to these specific areas. A technical interview should focus on assessing practical knowledge of Generative AI, deep learning frameworks, and the candidate's ability to apply these in real-world scenarios, specifically probing for experience in model deployment and performance optimization.", "status": "Rejected", "projects": [{"name": "in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural", "description": "Language Processing, Data Science, AI, and Python programming , the dynamic and\ntalented AI specialist has developed strong skills and shown proficiency in creating cutting -\nedge AI solutions to address challenging issues and advance corporate goals in a variety of\nfields.
